about me or www.jhearing.com 
we developed hearing aid solution on RSL10 chip and RSL20 chip , now we upload our medical-grade hearing aid software. you can add BT/le audio ,even AI speech enhancement features.
the RSL20 chip is low-power ,BLE5.2+ classic BT ,its ADC/DAC is well designed ,and suitable for audio products like hearing aid.
www.jhearing.com provide  hearing aid chip( RSL20 ) and algorithms for less than $10 USD
features include:
16-band WDRC (expansion knee/rate, compression knee/rate, limit knee,attacktime/releasetime,inr functions)
32-freq bin EQ
winner filter noise reduction (33 band)
band split and band merge
AFC (33 band)
configurable biquad filters 
pure tone test for audio meter
AGCO
the total power consumption (including DMIC,speaker, RSL20 ,all running ) is <2.5ma under 1.8v
ble web fitting : https://yp.jhearing.com/webj10_2025.php  (you can replace with yours )
DTMF tone and wave file support

2025-09-22: intial upload code  , the hearing aid algorithms ready ,and ble fitting function is ready ,we will add BT/le audio later . if you want to add BT/LE audio ,you can add by yourself .
the develop SDK is RSL20 SDK , see www.onsemi.com for how to develop based on RSL20
